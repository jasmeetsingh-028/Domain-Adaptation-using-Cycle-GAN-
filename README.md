# CycleGAN: Zebra to Horse and Horse to Zebra Transformation

This project showcases the implementation of a CycleGAN model using PyTorch for the transformation of images between two domains: zebras and horses. CycleGAN, short for Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks, is a type of generative adversarial network designed for unpaired image-to-image translation.

## Project Description

In this project, we leverage CycleGAN to perform image domain translation between zebras and horses. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capability of CycleGAN to learn a mapping between two domains without the need for paired training data. This means that we can train the model on a collection of images of zebras and horses without requiring corresponding images in both domains.

Key aspects of this project include:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of images featuring zebras and horses. These images serve as the source and target domains for transformation.

- **CycleGAN Architecture**: Implementing the CycleGAN architecture using PyTorch. This involves defining generators and discriminators for both the source and target domains.

- **Unpaired Image Translation**: Training the CycleGAN model to learn the mapping from zebras to horses and vice versa without requiring one-to-one image pairs.

- **Cycle-Consistency**: Ensuring cycle-consistency in image translation, meaning that an image translated from zebra to horse and back to zebra should be similar to the original zebra image, and vice versa.

- **Evaluation**: Assessing the quality of the generated images and the effectiveness of the transformation using appropriate evaluation metrics.

- **Visualization**: Visualizing the transformation results and comparing the generated images to the original input images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to set up the necessary Python environment with PyTorch and any additional dependencies required for image processing and visualization. The implementation details and training process will not be included in this README, but they can be found in the project's source code.
